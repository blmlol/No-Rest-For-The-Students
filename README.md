# On Topic
On Topic is a web app allowing users to search for keywords in three different databases, returning results of articles and videos (sourced via YouTube) related to that keyword. This is all part of Team No Rest For The Students's Project One for UCLA's Fullstack Web Development Coding Bootcamp (September 2019 to March 2020). Users may expand or collapse the Related Articles or Related Videos sections on selection of the header element. Users may also create a login for the app by selecting the Sign Up button, or if the user has a login and is returning to the web app, sign into their account by selecting the Login button.

We built this web app with a focus on being mobile responsive first. This web app allows users to get a quick read on articles related to their keyword(s) in different formats depending on which radio button is selected.

## Extra Bits
There are two extra buttons present on this web app: Fact of the Day, and NASA Image of the Day. 

Selecting the Fact of the Day button will generate a modal which provides a random fact related to the calendar date of a user based on their local timezone. Closing the modal and selecting the Fact of the Day button again will provide a new, random fact for that calendar date. This is generated by the Numbers API, specifically teh "date" portion, which generates a random fact for a give date upon requect made to the API.

The NASA Image of the Day button opens a modal which displays the Astronomy Picture of the Day from NASA, along with a brief explanation of the picture itself. This may be a photograph or a video. This image or video will change based on NASA's database updating daily. Selecting the button more than once will not change the image or video until the date has changed for the source website, which is set to GMT-5.
